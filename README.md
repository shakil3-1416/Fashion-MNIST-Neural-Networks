# Fashion-MNIST-Neural-Networks
Welcome to the Fashion-MNIST-Neural-Networks repository! This repository houses Python code that enables you to train and compare two distinct neural network models: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The focus of this code is image classification using the well-known Fashion MNIST dataset.
